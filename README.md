#LearnEzy


## 💡Inspiration💡

We concentrated on building a practical solution for mental health concerns and education throughout the brainstorming process. This application was inspired by students worldwide who were unable to access ideal circumstances in their online classrooms or had too much schoolwork to prioritize, making them agitated. We decided to use discord to set up a learning environment that combines the best of both worlds and uses each feature to its fullest potential.


## ❓What it does❓
Learnezy enables educators to start and run a classroom on their Discord server while teaching as efficiently and rapidly as they would in person.

## 🙋‍♂️What we learned🙋‍♂️
Throughout the hackathon, we learned a lot about web design, Python coding, dealing with Discord bots, and how to manage our limited time effectively. This project taught us how breaking down a problem into smaller pieces allowed us to tackle it by focusing on it.

Finally, we learned a lot from one other and Hawkhacks during the weekend.

## 💭What's next for Learnezy 💭
We intend to expand this platform and work with consumers to make it a genuine free product that benefits everyone while introducing new features and other improvements.
